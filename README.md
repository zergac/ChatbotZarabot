# ChatbotZarabot

INTRODUCTION

This course has introduced you to a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) concepts, including chatbots (also known as conversational agents, talkbots, chatterbots, bots, IM bots, interactive agents, or artificial conversational entities). Chatbots converse with humans using auditory or textual methods. These chatbots are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner. Chatbots alleviate the call volume of call centers by providing support to customers, providing assistance while shopping by recommending products, helping locate the best place to buy your favorite dish or order food, talking with you on a specific topic, or by helping you acquire information.

In this task, you will use the Pandorabot environment to create a conversational agent. This chatbot will be interacting with an undergraduate student who is nearing the completion of their degree plan. The student your bot will interact with may be starting to think about directing their career path in a specific direction or may be preparing for an interview. You will document the development of the chatbot and investigate the best calibration approaches and AI optimization methods that support the chatbot in having the required functionalities in the most efficient way.

SCENARIO

You are a career advisor working for a university that offers many degrees, including a degree in computer science. You know that there is a vast range of computing jobs and that students who are about to graduate are generally aware of their disciplinary preferences and personal strengths. The enrollment of computer science students at your university has been increasing and you can no longer meet with each of them individually to give career guidance. During a meeting of career advisors, your manager suggests that you develop a chatbot that will reduce your workload and interact with students to help them identify jobs in computing fields for which they are qualified.

You have been asked to identify five job types that require an undergraduate degree in computer science and construct a chatbot in the Pandorabot environment that will interact with individual students, help them identify their strengths and preferences, and help them decide which career options to consider
